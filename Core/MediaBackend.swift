//
// MediaBackend
//
// The single source of truth for which audio engine the app uses
// (SFBAudioEngine or Crescendo). It only reports the selected engine;
// it does not build or route anything. Each seam (the PlaybackEngine facade and
// the MetadataEngine facade) reads `current` and picks its own backend, so
// removing SFBAudioEngine later is a change to those facades plus this enum.
//
// Switching engines is an in-process swap driven from Settings (PlaybackEngine
// rebuilds its backend), so `current` is read at each seam's (re)build point
// rather than cached.
//
